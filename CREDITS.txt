Gencal was orginally written in perl-tk and was meant to be just a little script
that could be use to quickly generate gcode for my laser projects. As the
script grew I decided that others might have a use for it too. So I decided to
port it the newer and more popular lanuage python-tk. This is my first python
project and it borrows structure and code from the python 'IDLE' project.

For additional details refer to NEWS.txt and TODO.txt.
